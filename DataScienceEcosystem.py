# ### Below are a few examples of evaluating arithmetic expressions in Python

# In[7]:


# This a simple arithmetic expression to mutiply then add integers

(3*4)+5


# In[11]:


# This will convert 200 minutes to hours by diving by 60.
minutes = 200
hour = 60
convertedHours = minutes/hour
print(convertedHours)
